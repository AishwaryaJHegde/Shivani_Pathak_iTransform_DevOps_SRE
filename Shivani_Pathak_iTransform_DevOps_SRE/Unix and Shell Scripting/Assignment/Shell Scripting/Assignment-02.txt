Write a script that sets FOUR variables:

MYUSERNAME
MYPASSWORD
STARTOFSCRIPT
ENDOFSCRIPT

Populate the first two with some default value and use command redirection to set the third and fourth value to the date/time of 
when the script was started and completed.
Within the script, be sure to display the values to the terminal when run.

#!/bin/bash


echo USERNAME=Shivani
echo Password=******

echo STartofscript="#!usr/bin/env bash"
read one
echo ENDOFSCRIPT=$(date)

echo "enter end of script"
read two 
echo ENDOFSCRIPT=$two
